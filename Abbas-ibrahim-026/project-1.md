# **CLOUD SERVICE MODELS**
Cloud computing is a general term used to identify online delivery of data storage, processing, analytics, and other services, online without being dependent on local hardware. The businesses connect to the provider and use third-party services to enable their computing operations.

Further, cloud services can be distinguished based on their business model, functionality, and billing systems. Let’s take a look at the main types of cloud-based services and examine their features and differences.
## There are the  three models  of cloud service -

* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

* Platform as a Service (PaaS)

* Software as a Service (SaaS)


## **IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service**

Cloud infrastructure services, known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), are made of highly scalable and automated compute resources. It is fully self-service for accessing and monitoring computers, networking, storage, and other services. IaaS allows businesses to purchase resources on-demand and as-needed instead of having to buy hardware outright.

## *IaaS Delivery*

IaaS delivers cloud computing infrastructure, including servers, network, operating systems, and storage, through virtualization technology. These cloud servers are typically provided to the organization through a dashboard or an API, giving IaaS clients complete control over the entire infrastructure. IaaS provides the same technologies and capabilities as a traditional data center without having to physically maintain or manage all of it. IaaS clients can still access their servers and storage directly, but it is all outsourced through a “virtual data center” in the cloud.
## where and when to  use (*IaaS*)

* Startups and small companies may prefer IaaS to avoid spending time and money on purchasing and creating hardware and software.

* Larger companies may prefer to retain complete control over their applications and infrastructure, but they want to purchase only what they actually consume or need.

* Companies experiencing rapid growth like the scalability of IaaS, and they can change out specific hardware and software easily as their needs evolve. 

Anytime you are unsure of a new application’s demands, IaaS offers plenty of flexibility and scalability.

## **Examples of IaaS**

Popular examples of IaaS include:

* DigitalOcean
* Linode
* Rackspace
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure

## **PaaS: Platform as a Service**

Cloud platform services, also known as Platform as a Service (PaaS), provide cloud components to certain software while being used mainly for applications. PaaS delivers a framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create customized applications. All servers, storage, and networking can be managed by the enterprise or a third-party provider while the developers can maintain management of the applications.

## *PaaS Delivery*

PaaS provides a platform for software creation. This platform is delivered via the web, giving developers the freedom to concentrate on building the software without having to worry about operating systems, software updates, storage, or infrastructure.

PaaS allows businesses to design and create applications that are built into the PaaS with special software components. These applications, sometimes called middleware, are scalable and highly available as they take on certain cloud characteristics.


## When to Use PaaS
Utilizing PaaS is beneficial, sometimes even necessary, in several situations. For example, PaaS can streamline workflows when multiple developers are working on the same development project. If other vendors must be included, PaaS can provide great speed and flexibility to the entire process. PaaS is particularly beneficial if you need to create customized applications.

This cloud service also can greatly reduce costs and it can simplify some challenges that come up if you are rapidly developing or deploying an app.

## **Examples of PaaS**
Popular examples of PaaS include:

* AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
* Windows Azure
* Heroku
* Google App Engine
* OpenShift

## **SaaS: Software as a Service**

Software as a Service, also known as cloud application services, represents the most commonly utilized option for businesses in the cloud market. SaaS utilizes the internet to deliver applications, which are managed by a third-party vendor, to its users. A majority of SaaS applications run directly through the web browser, which means they do not require any downloads or installations on the client side.

## *SaaS Delivery*
Due to its web delivery model, SaaS eliminates the need to have IT staff download and install applications on each individual computer. With SaaS, vendors manage all potential technical issues, such as data, middleware, servers, and storage, resulting in streamlined maintenance and support for the business.


## When and where to Use SaaS
SaaS may be the most beneficial option in several situations, including:

* Startups or small companies that need to launch ecommerce quickly and don’t have time for server issues or software.
* Short-term projects that require quick, easy, and affordable collaboration.
* Applications that aren’t needed too often, such as tax software
* Applications that need both web and mobile access

## **Examples of SaaS**
Popular examples of SaaS include:

* Google Workspace (formerly GSuite) 
* Dropbox
* Salesforce
* Cisco WebEx
* SAP Concur
* GoToMeeting
